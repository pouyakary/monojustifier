In previous attempts of justification we might have broken a
chunk  into  splits. for  example  the  world 'extraordinary' might have been
broken into 'extr-'  and 'aordinary'.
When  reconstructing  the chunks, we have  to  add  them  together
into  their  whole. For that matter; the `cachedSplitChunk` works as a buffer, if
we find the first half (the head) we put it in  `cachedSplitChunk`  and  then  it
becomes  added  to  anything  that comes after it.
