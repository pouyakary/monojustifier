The  story of King Arthur and the sword is a long-forgotten tale, lost in  the  mists of time. It is a story of a boy who grew up to be a great king, and of a sword that was  said to have the power to bring peace
and prosperity  to  the  land.  The  story   begins  on a day when the King of England, Uther Pendragon, lay dying without an heir
to  his  throne.  And  so,  the  sword was  placed in a stone,  with  the  inscription  that only the true king could pull it out.
